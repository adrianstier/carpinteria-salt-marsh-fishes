        These data describe annual estimates of the density of fish in main channel and tidal creek habitats collected as part of the SONGS San Dieguito Wetland Restoration mitigation monitoring program designed to evaluate compliance of the restoration project with conditions of the SONGS permit. 
Monitoring began in 2012 in the San Dieguito Wetlands and Tijuana Estuary in San Diego County, CA, Carpinteria Salt Marsh in Santa Barbara County, CA, and Mugu Lagoon in Ventura County, CA. 
Beginning in 2024, Los Penasquitos Lagoon in San Diego County replaced Tijuana Estuary. 
The abundance of fish is determined using beach seine and enclosure trap sampling at six main channel and six tidal creek locations at each wetland. 
Both seine and enclosure trap sampling consist of several hauls through an enclosed volume of water. 
Sampling is conducted annually in early fall.

                  Overview
                  
The coastal development permit for SONGS Units 2 and 3 requires Southern California Edison to create or substantially restore a minimum of 150 acres of coastal tidal wetland. 
The permit establishes biological performance standards that must be met by the restored wetland. 
One of these standards requires that within 4 years of construction, the total densities and number of species of fish shall be similar to the densities and number of species of fish in similar habitats in the reference wetlands.

               
               
                  Study Sites
                  
Time series data of the fish community were collected in tidal creek and main channel / basin habitats using a combination of 0.43 m2 x 0.9 m circular enclosure traps and beach seines (generally 100m2) at the San Dieguito Wetland restoration site (32.9695450N, 117.260470W) and three reference wetlands (Tijuana Estuary 32.5699010N, 117.1267120W (2012-2023); Los Penasquitos Lagoon  32.92950N, 117.25310W (2024-present); Mugu Lagoon 34.1020070N, 119.0970110W; Carpinteria Salt Marsh 34.4011890N, 119.5379900W) as part of a long-term study designed to evaluate the performance of the restoration project. 
Beginning in 2024, Tijuana Estuary was replaced with Los Penasquitos Lagoon. 
The reference wetlands were chosen to represent relatively undisturbed, natural tidal wetlands within the Southern California Bight. 
Samples were collected annually in late-summer to fall (September – October). There are six tidal creeks and six main channel sampling locations in each lagoon. 
In 2024, four tidal creeks and six main channels were sampled at San Dieguito Wetlands. 

Enclosure traps were used to sample gobies, which are small, numerically abundant fishes that are poorly sampled by other methods (Steele et al., 1996a). 
There were five enclosure sampling stations at each tidal creek and main channel location. 
Traps were deployed in undisturbed areas during mid to low tides in main channels and at the thalweg of tidal creeks. 
Deployment depths were ≤ 0.9 m NGVD to avoid flooding the enclosed sampling area. 
Fish within the trap were collected using a Benthic Ichthyofauna Net for Coral/Kelp Environments (BINCKE), identified to species, counted and released (Anderson and Carr, 1998). 
Each trap was sampled with hauls of the BINCKE until no fish were collected in a total of three passes of the net. 
An annual survey using this method consisted of sampling five enclosure traps spaced ~10 m apart at each main channel and tidal creek location.

Beach seines in combination with blocking nets were used to sample larger more mobile fishes (Steele et al., 1996b). 
Main channel sampling locations were blocked off with two blocking nets (2 m high x 12.2 m wide and 2 m high x 24.4 m wide) rolled out 7.62 m apart on shore. 
They were deployed perpendicular to the shore reaching a depth of ~1.5 m or a distance of 12.2 m from shore, whichever came first. 
A dowel was placed marking the corner of the sampling area and the remaining length of the nets were pulled toward each other to close the blocked area. 
A beach seine (2 m high x 7.62 m wide) was hauled through the blocked area five times and non-goby fishes were identified to species, counted  and released. 
The two blocking nets were then pulled in and sampled for fish. 
The area sampled in tidal creeks was blocked off with two blocking nets (2 m high x 12.2 m wide) deployed perpendicular to the shore 7.62 m apart and extending across the creek. 
A beach seine (2 m high x 7.62 m wide) was hauled through the blocked area five times and non-goby fishes were identified to species, counted and released. 
The blocking net closest to the inlet of the creek was pulled in, sampled for fish, and then redeployed 7.62 m from the upland side of the still deployed blocking net. 
This second section of the tidal creek was sampled with five hauls of the beach seine and then the two blocking nets were pulled in and sampled for fish. 
This method was repeated on three dates. 
An annual survey using beach seines consisted of repeating this method at each main channel and tidal creek location on three different dates during late summer –fall. 
The location of the sampling areas on the three dates was slightly offset to minimize effects of physical alteration of habitat and to avoid sampling areas that might have been affected by previous sampling.

          The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) Mitigation Monitoring Program is based at the Marine Science Institute, University of California Santa Barbara.
          Long-term monitoring and evaluation of the SONGS mitigation projects is a condition of the coastal development permit issued by the California Coastal Commission (CCC) for the operation of SONGS Units 2 and 3.
          The Permit requires Southern California Edison (SCE) as majority owner and operating agent of SONGS to design and build mitigation projects that adequately compensate for the adverse effects of the power plant’s once-through seawater cooling system on coastal marine resources.
          UCSB scientists working under the direction of the Executive Director of the CCC are responsible for designing and implementing monitoring programs aimed at determining the effectiveness of these mitigation projects.
          
            
         
         
            
               Funding for the SONGS Mitigation Monitoring Program is provided by SCE as a requirement of their coastal development permit for operating SONGS.

               species code
               Code used to identify a species, generally composed of the first two letters of the genus (G) name and the first two letters of the species (S) name (format=GGSS). Species may have several codes used to identify different characteristics (e.g. size, age classes, etc). Some codes represent groups of unidentifiable or indistinguishable species.
