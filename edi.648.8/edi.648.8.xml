            <para>
        These data describe the annual estimates of density of wetland fish (all species combined) and the species richness (as the number of unique species) in six main channel and six tidal creek locations at four coastal wetlands as part of the SONGS San Dieguito Wetland Restoration monitoring program to track long-term patterns in species abundance and diversity. 
This study began in 2012 in the San Dieguito Wetland in San Diego County, CA, Carpinteria Salt Marsh in Santa Barbara County, CA, and Mugu Lagoon in Ventura County, CA. 
Tijuana Estuary in San Diego County was added in 2013. 
Beginning in 2024, Tijuana Estuary was replaced with Los Penasquitos Lagoon in San Diego County, CA.

                  <para>
The coastal development permit for SONGS Units 2 and 3 require Southern California Edison to create or substantially restore a minimum of 150 acres of coastal wetland. 
The permit establishes biological performance standards that must be met by the restored wetland. 
One of these standards requires that within 4 years of construction, the total densities and number of species of fish shall be similar to the densities and number of species of fish in similar habitats in the reference wetlands.

                  <title>Study Sites</title>
                  <para>
Time series data of the fish community was collected in tidal creek and main channel / basin habitats using a combination of 0.43m2 x 0.9 m circular enclosure traps and beach seines (generally 100 m2) at the San Dieguito Wetland restoration site (32.9695450N, 117.260470W) and three reference wetlands (Tijuana Estuary 32.5699010N, 117.1267120W (2012-2023); Los Penasquitos Lagoon  32.92950N, 117.25310W (2024-present); Mugu Lagoon 34.1020070N, 119.0970110W; Carpinteria Salt Marsh 34.4011890N, 119.5379900W) as part of a long-term study designed to evaluate the performance of the restoration project. 
The reference wetlands were chosen to represent relatively undisturbed, natural tidal wetlands within the Southern California Bight. 
Beginning in 2024, Tijuana Estuary was replaced with Los Penasquitos Lagoon. 
Fish were sampled in six tidal creek and six main channel-basin habitats at each wetland annually in late summer-early fall. In 2024, four tidal creek and six main channel-basin habitats were sampled at San Dieguito Wetlands.

               <section>
                  <title>Fish Abundance and Species Richness</title>
                  <para>
Estimates of fish abundance and richness (as the number of unique species) at each tidal creek and main channel location were calculated by combining the individual estimates of abundance and richness using two methods: (1) enclosure traps to sample gobies, which are small, numerically abundant fishes that are poorly sampled by other methods and (2) beach seines to sample larger mobile fishes. 
The methods for these surveys are found in the following data package:

SONGS Mitigation Monitoring: Wetland Survey - Fish Abundance

Five enclosure traps were sampled at each tidal creek and main channel location. 
Sampling an enclosure trap consisted of multiple hauls through a volume of water trapped by the enclosure. 
The abundance of fish within an enclosure trap was estimated as the sum of all fish counted in all hauls divided by the total area sampled by the enclosure. 
The density estimate for each tidal creek and main channel location was calculated as the average of the five sampling stations within each location.  

Two adjacent areas (= sections) were sampled with a beach seine for each tidal creek location, and one section was sampled for each main channel location. 
Each seine consisted of multiple hauls through a volume of water enclosed by blocking nets. 
The density of fish at each location was estimated as the sum of all fish counted in all hauls divided by the total area sampled in all sections by the seine.

The density estimates for enclosures and beach seines at each location were standardized to number per 1 m2, then added together to generate a combined estimate of total density of fish for each of the six replicate tidal creek and main channel-basin locations. 

Similarly, the number of unique species was estimated by calculating the number of unique species sampled by both methods at each tidal creek and main channel location, and adding them together to obtain the total number of unique species for the location. 
The number of unique species at each location sampled using enclosures was calculated as the number of unique species observed at all five sampling stations. 
The number of unique species at each location sampled using beach seines was calculated as  the number of unique species observed in all seine sections at that location.

          The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) Mitigation Monitoring Program is based at the Marine Science Institute, University of California Santa Barbara.
          Long-term monitoring and evaluation of the SONGS mitigation projects is a condition of the coastal development permit issued by the California Coastal Commission (CCC) for the operation of SONGS Units 2 and 3.
          The Permit requires Southern California Edison (SCE) as majority owner and operating agent of SONGS to design and build mitigation projects that adequately compensate for the adverse effects of the power plant’s once-through seawater cooling system on coastal marine resources.
          UCSB scientists working under the direction of the Executive Director of the CCC are responsible for designing and implementing monitoring programs aimed at determining the effectiveness of these mitigation projects.
